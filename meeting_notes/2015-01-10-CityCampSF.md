Should we have an organization to lend credibility, or start small and grow organically

People would rather produce art than go to a city planning meeting
We can use art to get people invovled

Fun can be defined in a number of ways, but must be a part of whatever we are doing

Get new people engaged in civic issues

Civic reporting / Mission Cultural Center / Locals

Fun heroes with a purpose / Civic Fun Squad might show up!

Make sure that there is a next step for whatever we do
Theater with a purpose
Improved disruptions
Volunteers @ public meetings
Free reporting
Sonnet or haiku form comments
Red carpet event / valet / gift baskets for civil servants
Make abstract policy tangible

Pre-arrange that we will show up
