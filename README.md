# civic-fun-squad
A group of civic designers and makers who build functional &amp; long-term civic community by planning fun &amp; civic-nerdy off-radar events.

#### Background
We formed out of planning the <a href="http://civicdesigncamp.org/">Civic Design Camp</a> in early 2014.

#### History
* So far we have gone bike-camping, but mainly we are an Ethos rather than a community or organization or movement. 
* We like to learn design techniques.
* We induct fun people who also generate opportunities for community-building.
* We do this because playing together creates a community-network effect that can support artists, makers and others who have emerging ideas.
* Our network also helps us work out ideas and challenges related to our many projects (for work, for art, for the future.)

#### What we can do in a digital medium (such as this git-repo)
We are pretty low key, but we can have some more focus and story-telling in 2015.

#### We can
* Design civic objects.
* Share ideas for inspirational and relevant civic activities.
* Tell stories of our adventures & distribute them to other places.
* Make a twitter list of participants or something simple like that.

#### What else?
